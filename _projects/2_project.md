## Introduction
I am in the process of developing a comprehensive ecosystem dedicated to the care of older adults. As an initial step, I am creating an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system specifically tailored for geriatric care. This EHR will not only streamline patient management but also enhance the quality of care by incorporating features that cater to the unique needs of older adults, ensuring they receive the attention and support they deserve.
